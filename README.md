## What I do

I'm a rust-proficient developer with high expertise on web3 and specialized on Solana development.

Also, I have a strong background working with react, react-native, postgres, firebase, and a bunch of other nice technologies.

I've also worked with Modern LLM AI sdks such as OpenAI and Google Vertex, plus have been playing with RAG and other limitations.
